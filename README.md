# Flight radar route network visualization

This is a python project that crawls the [flight_radar_24](https://www.flightradar24.com) site and plots the routes network of the 100 most popular european airports.



The program can crawl the flight-radar-24 website and create a .csv file that can be used to plot the routes network. Multiple datasets have already been generated (usually one per monrth) since 5/2018. 

The visualization can be customized based on the size of every airport's node as well as its color.

The image above was generated from the recorded routes on 15/5/2018

We were able to record the routes on the same day after two years (15/5/2020).You can clearly see the effect of the coronavirus pandemic in the density of routes.
