# Flight radar route network visualization

This is a python project that crawls the flight-radar site and plots the routes network of the 100 most popular european airports.

The program can crawl the flight-radar-24 website and create a .csv file that can be used to plot the routes network. I've already generated
multiple .csv files, one for every month since 5/2018. 

The visualization can be customized based on the size of every airport's node as well as its color.
